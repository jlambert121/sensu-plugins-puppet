## Installation Options
### Asset registration

Assets are the best way to make use of this plugin in Sensu Go. If you're not using an asset, please consider doing so! If you're using sensuctl 5.13 or later, you can use the following command to add the latest version of this asset: 

`sensuctl asset add sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-puppet`

If you're using an earlier version of sensuctl, you can download the asset definition from [this project's Bonsai Asset Index page](https://bonsai.sensu.io/assets/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-puupet).

## Notes

As the sensu user doesn't have read access to `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/state/last_run_summary.yaml` it is necessary to create an appropriate entry in `/etc/sudoers.d` and call `check-puppet-last-run.rb` or `metrics-puppet-run.rb` using `sudo`.
